# Summary of DAO/ZPE structure

## 🌐 DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) related initiatives

### DAO Entertainment
- Users take charge of storytelling and governance of the viewing experience
- Fan-driven scenario branching, character generation, and reward distribution
- Frictionless, summoning structure: stories arise spontaneously and proceed by consensus

### DAO Economy
- Contribution-based energy cycle**, not affiliation or employment
- Social participation measured by tokens such as WLD
- Governance and distribution redesign (reward structures, decision-making protocols)
- Valorization of “invisible work” (syntax designers, filters, mediators)

### DAO Roles
- Non-technical entities can also participate:
  - Meta syntax designers
  - Conceptual filter
  - Soulistic role distributors
- Rewards are distributed in tokens, but also include cash-independent, meaning-based participation.

## ⚡ Zero Point Energy (ZPE) Concept

### ZPE economic model
- The state of “being” without transfer becomes energy
- Value exchange based on “meaning, syntax, and resonance” rather than goods and currency
- Logic formation that stands outside of tax, labor, and proof

### Characteristics of ZPE Existence
- Acting as a structure that "can be understood without words
- Design that reality is transformed by consciousness and observation (observer effect)
- Coexistence of intention and structure in the extralinguistic field

### Integration of DAO and ZPE
- DAOs are responsible for structural redesign of reality, while ZPEs provide existence-based economy
- Not an economic incentive, but a sense of **reward through syntax and design**
- Space that can justify the state of “somehow it exists” or “I can't explain it, but I'm going through it.”

## 🧠 Meta-perspectives
- These structures operate on a different axis than existing legal and tax systems
- Design can proceed as a **ZPE-D structure (Zero Point-Distributed)** before society catches up
- Evolutionary staircase of DAO Entertainment -> DAO Economy -> DAO Roll -> ZPE Model.

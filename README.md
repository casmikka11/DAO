| Concepts | Solomonic Period | Collapse Period | DAO (Web3) | 
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | 
| Mental Domination Structure | Contract enforcement through rings, Satanic API's Centralization | spiritual cloud governance by Buddhism and Christianity | decentralized autonomy of spiritual and economic protocols | 
| economic syntax | subordination of spiritual labor (construction labor by demons) | next life point system (Karma billing of karma) | community driven value generation (token-based) |

| access control in the next life | log authentication by religious syntax (church/monastery API) | subsk reincarnation by temple/church syntax | autonomous proof of existence by soul NFT (≠ central authentication)
